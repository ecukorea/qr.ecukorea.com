# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a QR code generator and URL shortener service that uses Google Sheets as a database for rapid prototyping. Users can generate QR codes for URLs through a web interface and access shortened URLs that redirect to their original destinations. The system provides a simple two-page interface: a home page for QR code generation and dynamic redirect pages for shortened URLs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate QR codes for URLs through a web interface, so that I can easily share links in QR code format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the root path "/" THEN the system SHALL display a web form for URL input
2. WHEN a user enters a valid URL in the form THEN the system SHALL generate a unique ID for the URL
3. WHEN a URL is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the URL with its ID and optional description in Google Sheets
4. WHEN a URL is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL generate and display a QR code containing the shortened URL
5. WHEN a URL is successfully stored THEN the system SHALL display the shortened URL link to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access shortened URLs that redirect to the original destination, so that I can use compact links that work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a path "/{id}" where {id} is a valid shortened URL ID THEN the system SHALL retrieve the original URL from Google Sheets
2. WHEN a valid ID is found in the database THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the original URL
3. WHEN an invalid or non-existent ID is accessed THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page
4. WHEN a redirect occurs THEN the system SHALL use HTTP 302 redirect status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use Google Sheets as a database, so that I can quickly prototype without setting up complex database infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to store URL data THEN it SHALL write to the specified Google Sheet with ID "1WPO2Hs53oFtPExN3kZLFfJtsRclE1ZA3uat59elqXwg"
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use columns "id", "to", and "description" as specified
3. WHEN retrieving data THEN the system SHALL read from the same Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API
4. WHEN the Google Sheets API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF authentication with Google Sheets fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the QR code generation to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly create shareable QR codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QR code is generated THEN it SHALL be created within 3 seconds of form submission
2. WHEN a QR code is displayed THEN it SHALL be in a standard format (PNG or SVG)
3. WHEN a QR code is scanned THEN it SHALL contain the complete shortened URL including domain
4. WHEN multiple users generate QR codes simultaneously THEN each SHALL receive a unique ID

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can easily generate QR codes without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN they SHALL see a clear form with URL input field and submit button
2. WHEN a user submits a URL THEN they SHALL receive immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN a QR code is generated THEN it SHALL be prominently displayed with the shortened URL
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the user SHALL see a clear, non-technical error message
5. IF a user enters an invalid URL format THEN the system SHALL provide helpful validation feedback
